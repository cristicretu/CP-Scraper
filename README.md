# CP-Scraper

Competitive Programming Scraper is a python script that automatically creates input and output files, specific folders and pre-completed snippets, ***instantly***, for C++.

Also, it can open *VSCode, Vim or Atom* with all the freshly made files.

Your favourite editor is not in this list? No problem. It can still create the files with all the snippets, all you have to do is to open the freshly created folder by this script.

Currently, it supports ***codeforces.com***, ***infoarena.ro*** and ***pbinfo.ro***!

## Running

Run the following command to install the requirements: 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then execute using:
```
python3.9 main.py # this will run in the background and turn on when you copy a link
python3.9 simple.py # this will do a single-file creation
```
